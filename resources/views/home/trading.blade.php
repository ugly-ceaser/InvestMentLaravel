                                                Hedging an instrument by its corresponding Future OTC contract is forbidden (for swap-free accounts), because this represents an attempt to take advantage of the swap free facility and gain profits from swaps, one direction of this kind of hedge must be closed immediately. If the client fails to take action to avoid such practices, {{$settings->site_name}} will, unfortunately, be required to close or take other action (by deducting the swaps retroactively or any other means) on these accounts without further notice.<br><br>

                                                Hedged positions will be held in the trading account without affecting the required margin value, since the required margin is calculated for each instrument according to the net positions opened at a specific moment.

                                                The 1 (one) standard lot size is the measurement unit specified for each CFD contract. The possible choice of a leverage rate ranges from 1:1 up to 1:500 depending on the type of the CFD, the amount of trading volume active in the account and at the Company's discretion. At the opening of the Client Account, the leverage rate is set at 1:30 by default. The Client may change the leverage of his Client Account by contacting the Company. The Company has the right to allow a change to the Client Account leverage at the Company's discretion. In addition, the Company may, at its discretion, change the Client Account Leverage without any prior notice to the Client.  <br><br>

                                                Regardless of your account type or the amount of equity you have in your account, the leverage you will be allocated to trade with will be determined by the amount of trading volume you have in active use at any given time.  <br><br>

                                                The default leverage on all accounts is 1:30 based on CySEC regulation. Higher leverage will be available only upon client's request and will be executed at our sole discretion.  <br><br>

                                                Professional accounts will be handled individually and may not follow the above leverage rules.  <br><br>

                                                Utilizing a high level of leverage may extend your trading possibilities and lead to larger gains as well as higher risks; risks might be reduced by following a strict trading strategy at the opening and closure of your transactions.

                                     The client must abide the rules as declared on the {{$settings->site_name}} broker corporate website Contract Specification section for each CFD, including the margin requirements; and the Client shall provide and maintain the Initial Margin within such limits as the Company, at its sole discretion, may determine, set, or update. <br><br>

                                                It is the Client's responsibility to ensure that he understands how a Margin is calculated. <br><br>

                                                {{$settings->site_name}} has the right to amend any entry in the Contract Specifications section for each CFD including margin requirements, and these changes may take effect on both new and existing/open positions/trades; which may be declared through an internal mail message or on the company's corporate website; unless a Force Majeure Event has occurred. <br><br>

                                                In case of a Force Majeure Event, {{$settings->site_name}} has the right to change Margin requirements without prior written notice to the Client. In this situation, the Company has the right to apply new Margin requirements to new positions and to positions which are already open. <br><br>

                                                If the Equity to Margin (necessary margin) ratio falls below 5% at any time, {{$settings->site_name}} has the right to close any or all of the Client's open positions without the Client's consent or any prior written notice. In order to determine if the Client has breached this clause, any sums referred to therein which are not denominated in the Currency of the Client Account shall be treated as if they were denominated in the currency of the Client Account by converting them into the currency of the Client Account at the relevant exchange rate for spot dealings in the foreign exchange market. <br><br>

                                                The Client is responsible for notifying the Company as soon as he believes that he will be unable to meet a Margin payment when due. <br><br>

                                                The Company has no obligation to make Margin Calls for the Client. <br><br>

                                                Where the Company effects or arranges a transaction involving an instrument, the Client should note that, depending upon the nature of the transaction, he may be liable to make further payments when the transaction fails to be completed or upon the earlier settlement or closing out of his position. He may be required to make further variable payments by way of Margin against the purchase price of the instrument, instead of paying (or receiving) the whole purchase (or sale) price immediately. A movement in the market price of the Client's investment will affect the amount of margin payment he will be required to make. The Client agrees to pay the Company on demand such sums by way of margin as are required from time to time under the rules of any relevant Market (if applicable) or as the Company may, at its discretion reasonably require for the purpose of protecting itself against loss or risk of loss on present, future or contemplated transactions under this Agreement.

                                    Slippage involves executing any given trade on a specific price different from the expected price sent or preset by the client. This may take place during highly volatile market conditions such (but not limited to) economic or political news; the order will be filled at the next best available market price because, but not limited to - the desired/preset order price is not available, or because higher spread differences are applied in the corresponding exchanges of the traded instrument. <br><br>

                                                {{$settings->site_name}} does not apply slippage under normal market conditions, and applies it on stop pending entry or liquidation orders during times when {{$settings->site_name}} is closed or when - but not limited to - there is a weekend or bank holiday, international economic events or hectic market movements. In this case, stop orders will be filled on the opening price which {{$settings->site_name}} finds suitable. <br><br>

                                                Clients acknowledge that slippage might occur as per the liquidity providers’ terms and conditions and that this is beyond the control of {{$settings->site_name}} Limited and agrees to waive {{$settings->site_name}} from any liability that may arise subjective to any damage or expense or loss incurred by the Client, in relation to or directly or indirectly arising from but not limited to such terms and conditions.

                                    Scalping is a trading strategy through which the trader (Scalper/Pip Hunter) attempts to take advantage of small price moves and narrow ranges by making many transactions on small price changes over a small time frame. <br><br>

                                                Scalping is allowed on variable spread account types. Please refer to our account types table account types table <br><br>

                                                However, {{$settings->site_name}} does not permit scalping on Fixed spread account types (Classic account). In case {{$settings->site_name}} classifies a Classic account holder as a scalper or a pip hunter, the company may, at its sole discretion, and without a prior written notice, take one of the following actions: <br><br>

                                                * Change the account type to the corresponding variable spread account type <br>

                                                * Terminate this Agreement <br>

                                                * Close out all or any of the Client's open positions at current market prices <br>

                                                * Debit the Client Trading Account(s) for the amounts which are due to the Company <br>

                                                * Close any or all of the Client Trading Accounts held with the Company <br>

                                                * Combine Client Trading Accounts; consolidate the Balances in such Client Accounts and offset those Balances <br>

                                                * Refuse to open new Client Trading Accounts for the Client
